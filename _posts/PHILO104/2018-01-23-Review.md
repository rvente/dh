## Essay review 

### Section 1: Art. H: Warren

Person
:    a member of the moral community; a human in the moral sense; a bearer of moral rights

We have two tests to determine if something is human is the genetic test and the moral test. According to the genetic test, then a body part, and even a recently killed body are said to possess humanity although they clearly are not morally human. Instead, Warren proposes a set of criteria to remedy this.

5 Psychological capacities
* capacity to suffer or feel pain
* capacity to reason
* capacity to engage in self motivated activity
* capacity to be self-aware, or conscious
* capacity to communicate

You can use counterexamples to illustrate this. Alien being, A.I., an Artificial Organism, Dead Body, Severed Limb, Placenta, Coma Victim.

You can explain *why* the example of an extraterrestrial being is not a bad example

### Section 2: Art. I: Rachels

#### AMA's View on Euthanasia

| Passive     | Active        |
|-------------|---------------|
| permissible | impermissible |
| moral       | immoral       |

The Sanctity of Life
:    life is sacred, life is never to be destroyed

#### Rachels' View

| Passive       | Active        |
|---------------|---------------|
| consequential | consequential |
| varied        | varied        |

The Humanitarian Motivation
:   maximally reduce suffering

Would you recommend a different sentence between a woman who intentionally let her child die, and the same woman, who actively killed her child? If the motivations are the same then there should be no difference between passive or active means of killing.

### Section 3: Art. J: Singer

If you reject racism, and sexism, you should also reject species-ism.

Just because we have something that's caused by natural selection doesn't mean that it's right. There are examples of naturally selected things that don't align with our morality. One example of this is acting violent in situations where we are jealous etc.

### Section 4: Art. K McPherson

We should be consistent in how we view terrorism and war.

ANC Proves that terrorism as a last resort, with a just cause, and in self defense, can be moral. (Objection: The ANC cannot be used as a guiding example to judge murders. Counter-objection: He's not saying that we should judge ALL cases of terrorism as good, but rather, independently assess the morality of each case.

If you killed Hitler in a bombing organized in a group, that would absolutely make you a terrorist, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you did the wrong thing.
