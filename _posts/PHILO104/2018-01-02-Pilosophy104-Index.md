## Philosophy Notes PHILO 104 Introduction to Ethics and Moral Judgement

I will organize this document on homework assignments. At first glance, it seems that the readings for each night are more related than not, so I group them together to make it a tad bit more organized and easy to navigate than it would if linked topics were stored in different files.

I am writing this in Markdown and you can find the github repo that hosts the content [here](https://github.com/rvente/ink). If you want to contribute, just hit me up with a `pull request` on github or create an `Issue.` If you want to make a print-out or compile anything on your own, that's totally fine, just don't try to sell it to anyone without my knowledge. That's not to say that this will be a set of notes that would warrant selling, but you can rest assured that my passion for Philosophy extends into my note taking. I will also have asides that look like this:

> This is an aside. It should be fairly obvious, but don't mistake this for a quote. This is where I just jot that what I'm thinking about. Some of the time, these thoughts will get resolved later. Other times, it will lead nowhere.

I have an obligation to say that reading my notes is not a substitute for reading the articles and my notes are no substitute for your own. (Let's frame this as an ethical dillema: On one hand, I help people who use this only under extreme circumstances, and who take their own notes and study by themselves. On the other hand maybe knowledge of this resource makes people less likely to read and take notes on the article, leaving them worse off. Well, the anarchist in me resolves this by saying that all knowledge belongs in the hands of the people. It is their right to have access to knowledge, and I must trust this resource not to be abused.)
