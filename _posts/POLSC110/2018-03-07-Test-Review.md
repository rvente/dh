## Day 2 - Types of Governments

### Types of Governments

#### Governmental Organization

Monarchy

* rule by a monarch who has absolute control

Constitutional Monarchy

* a monarchy that reduces or alters the powers of the king using a constitution
  that enables democratic reform e.g. United Kingdom

Democracy

* a catch-all to describe all republics and direct democracies, a government
  where the people have voting rights which enables the people to directly or
  indirectly decide legal policy 
     
Liberal Representative Democracy

* a representative democracy that has equal rights for members of its society:
  rights are encoded in a constitution and applied equally regardless of factors
  like class or ethnicity e.g. France, Canada, Sweden 
     
Theocracy

* a government that has religion as one of the principles that decide policy:
  usually accompanied by a state sponsored religion and might have prominent
  religious figures as the heads of state 
 
Illiberal Democracy

* a "democracy" where the people actually don't have much influence over policy
  changes, people have described the Russian Federation as such 
     
Kleptocracy

* a government ruled by a person or party that exploits natural or labor
  resources in order to further the ruling class' on personal wealth 
     
Kakistocracy

* "rule by the worst," a government that is run by the selfish, greedy, or 
     generally people who don't care about who they are ruling over

#### Relationships of the State and Market

Capitalism

* the means of productions, distribution, and exchange, are owned by private
  entities (not state ones) 
* wage labor is employed, paying by time as opposed to productivity
* production is tailored for exchange rather than need

Socialism (Social Democracy)

* partial ownership of the means of production by the state 
* comprehensive social safety net of unemployment benefits, public education and
  public 
  healthcare 
* underlying mode of production is still market capitalism with the majority of
  the industry possessed by capitalists 
* heavy progressive taxation (the wealthy are taxed at a higher rate than the
  poor)
  
Communism (State Capitalism)

* the state owns the majority of the means of production and manages the
  majority of production in society
* comprehensive social safety nets
* may employ markets at a tiny scale

### Who Rules America Today?

America is a Liberal Democracy in theory, but in practice it appears to be a
capitalist (plutocratic) democracy. The subversion of the democratic process by
capitalists in America causes policy to be very inelastic to public demand. In
other words, corporations often have more of a say in what is done when
compared to the average American

#### Consent of the Governed

Tacit consent

* the consent given by people who are complicit in the current systems and don't
  challenge them.

Explicit Consent

* explicitly allowing a government to rule you

#### Why are governments made?

Governing 

* imposes order
* ensures liberty
* promotes equality

What is a government?

* monopoly on the legitimate use of violence (Weber)
* makes laws (Lowi)
* voting is useful in exercising power, but it might also implicate us in our
  own subordinatt blocker....I am out of youion

## Day 3 - Federalism

### Defining different distributions of power

Federalism

* two levels of government are sovereign

Confederation

* power flows up from the bottom
* e.g. US under the Articles of Confederation, United Nations

Unitary Government

* authority is concentrated exclusively in the central government
* there is only one authority, and it may create sub-units

### Federal System of the United States

The states did not create the constitutional system with a new national
government.

The National Government was created by the people and is both autonomous and
supreme.

Under the Articles of Confederation, each state retains its autonomy except for
powers that the confederation mentions outright.

By contrast, the Constitution has its Supremacy Clause, which designates laws of
the federal government as the "supreme law of the land"

### Important Clauses in the American Constitution

Supremacy Clause
the constitution and federal laws an treaties "shall be the supreme law of the
land"

Commerce Clause
"congress [is given the] power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and
among the several states"

2nd Amendment
"a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed"

10th Amendment
"the powers not delegated... by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the
States, are reserved for the States... or to the people"

### Important Court Cases

McCoulloch v. Maryland (1819)

* first federal ruling
* Maryland tried to stop the second bank of the US by imposing a tax on out of
  state banks (of which the second bank of the United states was the only one.)
* Chief Justice John Marshall: "Power to tax is the power to destroy"
* The Court ruled that in accordance with Article 1, Section 8 of the
  Constitution, Maryland could not tax the Federal Bank because the federal bank
  was necessary for the Federal government to carry out its enumerated powers.
  
### Dynamic Federalism

Meaning of Federalism changes over time due to the flexibility of the
constitution. This flexibility also keeps it from being outdated. It
interpretation changes over time.

Mostly, US federalism has been changing to allocate more and more power to the
federal government. Commerce clause has been the main vehicle for increasing
such federal power.

During the Great Depression, F.D. Roosevelt expanded the role of the federal
government fiscally speaking with the passage of the New Deal laws.

In the post Regain era, the Grants-in-Aid programs gave states more rights
because now they were free to do what they wanted with those grants. Now, the
federal government provides 37 percent of state revenue.

Dual Federalism

* separate powers designated to each form of government
* 10th amendment applies, strongly designating who has what powers
* Founding to 1937

Cooperative Federalism

* powers overlap and share power
* Article 6: Supremacy Clauses

Inverted Federalism

* states take initiatives when it comes to innovating on the behalf of the
  people
* in the past, it was the federal government that did the innovation (under FDR,
  for example)

## Day 4 - Founding and Structure of the Federal Government

The framers of the constitution had several problems when it came to who the
constitution should value most.

| Issue                                             | Compromise            |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Represent states equally or by population?        | Bicameral Legislature |
| Represent slaves or not?                          | 3/5ths compromise     |
| How to keep one branch from getting too powerful? | Checks and balances   |

### The Articles of Confederation and its Problems

Written in 1777 and ratified in 1781

The Federal government had

* no power to tax, so it couldn't pay former soldiers of the Revolutionary War
* no president
* no judiciary (action requires 9/13 or more majority)
* no army
* no national currency

#### Shay's Rebellion

The recession after the Revolutionary War was forcing farmers to default on
mortgages. These farmers were former soldiers who weren't paid. Shays led a mob
to shut down Massachusetts court. [TODD: Lecture sides are uninformative, append
from textbook]

#### Constitutional Convention

* Philadelphia - Summer 1787
* 55 Elites were the delegates
* They were Educated, wealthy men

#### The Great Compromise

Proportional Representation vs Equal Representation of states

Virginia Plan - Population Representation

* both houses based on population
* single exec elected by congress
* national judiciary elected by congress

New Jersey Plan - Equal Representation

* One house of congress
* all states get the same amount of votes
* judiciary appointed by an executive

Compromise:

* Bicameral Legislature
    * House of Representives has proportional Representation
    * Congress has equal representation
