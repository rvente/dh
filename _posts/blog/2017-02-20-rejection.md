I'm not used to rejection. I'm always qualified for the risks I take, and I take the risks I'm qualified to. So rejection has always been kind of devastating to me. 

Now I know the way things are is forcing me to change that. I applied to colleges I knew I wouldn't get into. That's just what you do. You miss a hundred percent of the shots you don't take. And I can't really afford not to take them. That was literal, not figurative. At my economic state, admission is equivalent to a full scholarship. Ivy Leagues will pay a hundred percent if you're poor enough and still somehow manage to slide in.

I promised myself I wouldn't cry or anything, but not all promises are meant to be kept. There's no chance, and yet I'm obsessed with this tiny glimmer of hope, my own construction. I wish I could just accept it. If this were coherent to the rest of my mental hearing the words "You're not good enough" should inspire that magical force that makes me change. Instead, I just sit around sulking and do nothing but feel depressed all day.

That's it. There's not a happy ending waiting for you at the end of this web page. Rejection is awful and sad and sometimes it's all we have. I guess I'll just have to find a way to learn from it somehow.
