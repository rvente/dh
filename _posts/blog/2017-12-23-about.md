My name is Ralph Vent√©, and I'm a philosopher, polyglot-glossophile, student, Ultimate Frisbee player, but most of all, a software freedom activist. I was born on a little island called Haiti. I moved to the United States when I was three years old. I went through the schooling system, and made my way to [Brooklyn Latin](http://www.brooklynlatin.org).

Now, I'm in the existential limbo between high school and college. A lot of my life will be determined in the next few months and I can't wait to hit the next leg of my journey.

### 23 December 2017

Hey, it's me again! I'm having a great time at Macaulay Honors Hunter. I've taken one semester of Python and I started taking C++. I'm having a total ball and I'm still so excited for what is to come. I want to make a few apps with the knowledge I've taken on, but I anticipate needing to teach myself a few more topics to complete the. 

First, I want to make Granger, a graphical version of the ranger file browser. I want to prioritize visuals. I might initially fork something like Pantheon, but my plans are more extravagant in the long term. I want panes to slide around with beautiful animations. I want to add emacs bindings for all my emacs friends. Previews are a MUST for everythong. PDFs, Word docs, Programs, you name it.

Second, I want to make a modal math input method using latex, and some traits of stenography. In MATH mode, s = sin( , c = cos( l = log and so on. Each function will put you in insert mode afterwards like c or a in vim. Then, in normal mode the qwer- row acts like numbers. In normal mode, you can steno-in operations like + - * and /. For parens, you can tab to move cursor to the end of the line, for exponents, you can use tab to return to the base layer.

I wonder what the standard procedure is for designing and road-mapping applications is. Hmm... I'll be right back...
