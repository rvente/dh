My name is Ralph Vent√©, and I'm a philosopher, polyglot-glossophile, student,
Ultimate Frisbee player, but most of all, a software freedom activist. I was
born on a little island called Haiti. I moved to the United States when I was
three years old. I went through the schooling system, and made my way to
[Brooklyn Latin](http://www.brooklynlatin.org).

Now, I'm in the existential limbo between high school and college. A lot of my
life will be determined in the next few months and I can't wait to hit the next
leg of my journey.

I'm no longer in said limbo. As a matter of fact, you could almost say I got
into heaven. Almost. Macaulay Honors accepted me, and I'm happiliy on my way to
understanding the world's programming languages. I'm thrilled with the thoughts
of everything I can do with my new powers.
