# Are We Saying the Wrong Things About Immigration?

Ever since Trump spouted his vulgar, racist, repulsive comments about immigrants, I've noticed a disturbing trend in the responses to it. 

> Immigrants from these sh*thole countries are more educated even than the US average.

> The immigrants end up being our nurses, doctors, lawyers.

> These sh*thole immigrants commit so much hard work to us, and the whole US economy would be impossible without it. 

Don't get me wrong, I understand exactly why people are saying this. It refutes the traditional rebuttals to immigration. 

> Immigrants bring crime.

> Immigrants contribute nothing to our society.

I get it, but let me ask the following: Would you not support immigration, even if immigrants only matched the US average in all of their statistics? If immigrants made the country no better or worse. Would your stance take a 180 if immigrants *weren't* any better or worse than the US average?

My answer is a resounding **no.** I don't care whether immigrants match or exceed the US average for being educated. Because the point of taking in immigrants is not to import intellectual capital. The point isn't even to import that hard-working attitude that leads to immigrants topping the charts. 

The point of immigration is to save the lives of people who have no other options. The point of immigration is to give immigrants a way out of lives that hold no promise. 

Immigrants come from places with no social mobility. Imagine a town ruled by gangs or cartels where you live in constant fear of being hit by a stray bullet. Where every firecracker on New Years day might actually be a bullet hurtling towards your head because you're out of money to pay your right to live.

Immigrants come from places with no prospects for a better life. Imagine your government, overthrown by a US-backed military dictatorship, replace cartel bullets with secret police bullets. Long hours at a textile factory. Not a dollar to spare after rent has been payed. Nepotism outweighs merit. Anyone who says the word "union" mysteriously vanishes. That's the secret totalitarianism of the developing world.

So what do we say?  "You only deserve to live if you are going to come here and get a 4 year degree?" and end up in deep debt and work any job to get out of it? Do we say, "We only want you if you're going to add value to our country?"

I thought we said

> "Give me your tired, your poor, <br />
> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, <br />
> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. <br />
> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, <br />
> I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

Our focus should be on the humanity of the people that we're saving. We shouldn't portray immigrants as dutiful supporters of the American Dream, we should see them as our extended family. We shouldn't help immigrants because we're rich and they're helpless, but because it's our obligation to do so. It's our necessity. It's our duty.

Thanks for listening.
