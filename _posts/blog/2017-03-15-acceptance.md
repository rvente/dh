This entry starts off as any good post should: with Latin!

It means "If something happens to someone who wants it but doesn't dare to hope, this is especially welcome to the soul."

Few words could capture this feeling more elegantly than Catullus himself did some millennia ago. This is exactly how I felt opening my decision email today. I had already prepared to be plunged into yet another spiral of dread and regret. Somehow, though, all of my expectations were shattered. Somehow, I convinced someone somewhere to believe in me. There's something delicate and fragile about it all. I need to prove them right. I need to become 4.0 Ralph and prove them that they were onto something when they said this poor immigrant from Brooklyn should be admitted.

I've been accepted to Macaulay Honors at CUNY Hunter!

I have a long way to go in life. This is only the first step to who I'm bound to become. I've never been more excited for what the future has in store.
