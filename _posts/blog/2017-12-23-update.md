title: "Even More About Me -- An Update"

Hey, it's me again! I'm having a great time at Macaulay Honors Hunter. I've
taken one semester of Python and I started taking C++. I'm having a total ball
and I'm still so excited for what is to come. I want to make a few apps with the
knowledge I've taken on, but I anticipate needing to teach myself a few more
topics to complete the.

First, I want to make Granger, a graphical version of the ranger file browser. I
want to prioritize visuals. I might initially fork something like Pantheon, but
my plans are more extravagant in the long term. I want panes to slide around
with beautiful animations. I want to add emacs bindings for all my emacs
friends. Previews are a MUST for everythong. PDFs, Word docs, Programs, you name
it.

Second, I want to make a modal math input method using latex, and some traits of
stenography. In MATH mode, s = sin( , c = cos( l = log and so on. Each function
will put you in insert mode afterwards like c or a in vim. Then, in normal mode
the qwer- row acts like numbers. In normal mode, you can steno-in operations
like + - * and /. For parens, you can tab to move cursor to the end of the line,
for exponents, you can use tab to return to the base layer.

I wonder what the standard procedure is for designing and road-mapping
applications is. Hmm... I'll be right back...
