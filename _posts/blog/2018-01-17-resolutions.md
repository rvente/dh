# Is it going to be different this time?


Here is my single New Years Resolution:

* Stop living for yourself, start living for the world.

That's quite vague, let me specify. I need to stop setting goals for myself. I need to start setting metrics to judge myself in the wider context of things. Let me give an example. I can be the best coder in my class. I can think of solutions to problems in Python quicker than anyone else in my class can. But the world doesn't care. I need to be so good in fact that I can help my struggling classmate. I need to be so good that I can help others get to my level. I need to be so good that I can make class worth my classmates' while regardless of how terrible our professor is. I need to be so good that I can make a review guide for my classmates without fear that it would reduce the curve. I need to start setting goals like this and living up to them. I've been making excuses for myself for far too long.

Worse of all, the world will still not care. They'll still see initially that one black kid that might have all the drive in the world, but can't deliver enough of a value to our company. So, I need to work twice as hard. I need to commit. I need to set reasonable goals. I need to achive them. I need to be the best of the best, just to stand a chance. I don't know who would hire me if I did anything else.

I need to stop thinking that things will just come to my if I work hard. Just hard isn't hard enough. Top of the class isn't working hard enough. Maybe state level is. Maybe higher is. 

This isn't my first time I've asked myself to stop making excuses. And that brings us to the question: Is it going to be different this time? How am I going to make it different this time? I've thought of the possibility that I'm asking too much from myself. I know now that's false. I can't stop setting these lofty goals for myself unless I actually give myself a chance to acheive the.

My GPA is 3.9. I got an A- in English class. I failed to understand that attending class and being engaged wasn't enough. I failed to understand in time that working hard wasn't good enough for our professor. You need to be your professor's little robot sometimes. You need to attend office hours with them. You need to turn in your final draft for review 3 days before the deadline, asking them for revisions to do. 

In this world, it's not enough to be enough for yourself. You have to be enough for the unforgiving market economy. You need to specialize and outcompete. And best of all, you need to elevate others to your status.

I hope you're ready for the post I'll make in 6 months or 2 months or 3 weeks about how I've failed or given up or lost focus. Or maybe that post will never come. The question is: what am I willing to sacrifice?
