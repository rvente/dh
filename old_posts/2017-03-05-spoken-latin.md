I decided, to what is likely my ultimate disadvantage to audition for public declamation. Speaking in front of a huge crowd has never been something I would see myself doing. The prospect is terrifying. I don't know what brought me to write my name on the near-full sheet of paper posted on the bulletin board. Whatever, what's done is done. I figure if it's driving me nuts, I can always just completely biff the tryouts, but with this week of break in between now and then, I have no reason not to try.

I finally decided on Aeneas' speech to his men, who are beached on an island. It's funny that I said 'finally' like it was some long arduous process. I simply asked Magister Jaffe, my Latin master, what he though and chose that exact piece. The tough part is selecting a translation. Do I want it to be archaic, modern, or somewhere in between? Should it be in plain prose, or should it rhyme? These are just a few of the questions you ask yourself. I chose [this one](https://www.fas.harvard.edu/~classics/poetry_and_prose/Aeneid.1.195-207.html) but don't click the link unless you want a quicktime movie in your downloads folder. The translation is written by a guy called Dryden. It's pretty loose from my first impressions, but I think it's cool. It's got what looks to be a consistent meter, it rhymes, and it sounds a bit pretentious. I mean get a load of this:

> He set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd,
>
> In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd.

So that's it. I'm memorizing the Latin bits first, so there's always a chance that I'll hop ship, but knowing my lazy self, there's not much substance to that possibility.

That brings me to this part of the post. Whether you want it [stale and slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orzrnEzKbaE) or whether you like hearing [a German man almost shouting his head off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dOv-Tm6RiY) there are many places on YouTube to find people speaking Latin. One day, I'll be among them, shouting my face off reading off Sappho, or Catullus. We'll see where it all takes me.

That's it for now, this is Triaux signing out.

Turns out I would not go on to declaim publically. That's okay though, because all of our declaimers totally slew. I'll do something big though. This is one I'm not going to let myself get out of.
